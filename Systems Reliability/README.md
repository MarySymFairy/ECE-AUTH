# Reliability of Systems

## 9th Semester, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2024-2025

## Course objective
OMERE Assignment and a Bibliographic work for the submarine disasters of Kursk and Titan.

## Bibliographic Work  "Case study of Submarine Disasters (Titan - Kursk) from a reliability perspective"
Written in Greek in the IEEE form.

## OMERE Assignment Overview
This course focuses on **satellite radiation effects analysis** using **OMERE software**. Students will gain hands-on experience in evaluating the impact of space radiation on electronic components and systems.

Students will conduct an in-depth analysis using **OMERE**, covering key aspects of radiation effects:
- **Orbital Environment Definition**: Selecting a specific space mission scenario.
- **Radiation Exposure Estimation**: Calculating Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Displacement Damage Dose (DDD).
- **Single Event Effects (SEE) Analysis**: Assessing potential failures due to space radiation.

## Development Phases (Deliverables)

### Deliverable 1: Mission & Environment Selection
- Define the satellite's **orbit parameters** and **mission profile**.
- Identify relevant **radiation sources** (trapped particles, cosmic rays, solar events).

### Deliverable 2: Radiation Dose Estimation
- Calculate **TID and DDD** for the selected components.
- Use OMERE to generate **shielding analysis** reports.

### Deliverable 3: SEE Analysis & Mitigation Strategies
- Evaluate **Single Event Effects** for key electronic components.
- Suggest **radiation hardening techniques** to mitigate risks.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Accuracy of radiation exposure calculations**.
- **Proper use of OMERE software tools**.
- **Clarity and depth of analysis in reports**.
- **Feasibility of mitigation strategies**.
