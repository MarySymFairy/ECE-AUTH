# Software-Engineering-II-Project in ECE AUTH

## 9th Semester, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2024-2025

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Course Objective
This course builds on Software Engineering I, focusing on **project management, CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment), software testing, and quality metrics integration** to ensure high-quality software development.

## Course Project
Students will enhance their previous project of ([Software Engineering I](https://github.com/MarySymFairy/ECE_AUTH_projects/tree/main/Software%20Engineering%20I)) by:
- Developing a **backend API** with at least 10 routes (**GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**) using **Swagger**.
- Ensuring the system includes at least **three interacting entities**.


## Development Phases (Deliverables)

### Deliverable 1 (Due: 13/11/2024)
- Create/update Swagger API documentation.
- Generate backend/frontend code via **SwaggerHub** and host on **GitHub**.
- Establish **project management** in **Cyclopt**, ensuring agile methodology adherence.

### Deliverable 2 (Due: 11/12/2024)
- Implement a **testing strategy** covering at least **90% of the code** with unit and acceptance tests.
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** to automate testing and deployment.

### Deliverable 3 (Due: 08/01/2025)
- Assess and improve **code quality metrics** using **Cyclopt**.
- Refactor code based on static analysis feedback while maintaining functionality.

## Evaluation Criteria
Grades will be based on:
- **API correctness and completeness**.
- **Code quality and maintainability**.
- **Project management discipline** and adherence to agile practices.
- **Testing coverage and CI/CD implementation**.

## Summary
This course provides hands-on experience in **full-cycle software development**, preparing students for real-world engineering challenges. ðŸš€
