# Database-Project in ECE AUTH

## 9th Semester, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2024-2025

## Phases of Development
This repository is a database project designed to store and manage data related to the Neurosync technology, which is a type of biofeedback or brain training method. The project is in an early stage of development, focusing on database setup and initial data handling. It is divided in 3 phases. 

### 1ο Παραδοτέο (First Deliverable)

* Includes a PDF document explaining the database structure in detail.
* The document contains the schema, table relationships, and key design choices for the database.

### 2ο Παραδοτέο (Second Deliverable)

* Contains the SQL implementation of the database.
* Includes the scripts to create the database schema and populate it with initial data.

### 3ο Παραδοτέο (Third Deliverable)

* Consists of the frontend and backend implementation of the project, which integrates with the database created in the earlier phases.
* The backend is responsible for handling API requests and database interactions.
* The frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the system.
* Both components are designed to demonstrate the functionality of the Neurosync database in a real-world application.

## 3rd deliverable - Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This repository contains a full-stack application built using React for the frontend and Node.js (Express.js) for the backend, leveraging a database for data management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** You can download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). npm usually comes bundled with Node.js.
*   **Git:** To clone the repository. If you don't have it, download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **Database configuration:**  The application is set up to be used with a database. If you plan to run your own database you should install:
     *   **MySQL:** It will require you to install a MySQL server and client tools. You can download MySQL Community Edition from [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).  You can use MySQL Workbench or another client.

## Execution Instructions

Follow these steps to run the application:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to where you'd like to clone the project, then run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarySymFairy/NeurosyncDB.git
   cd NeurosyncDB
   ```

### 2. Database Configuration
**Local Database:** To set up a local MySQL instance:
  *   Ensure you have a MySQL server installed and running.
  *    Create a database named `my_db` (change the name if you like). You can use MySQL Workbench or the `mysql` command-line client, or another database management tool.
  *   **VERY IMPORTANT:** Make sure to create an .env file containing your sensitive data, according to .env.example, to connect your DB to the project.
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials.  **Do not commit the .env file to your repository!** It contains sensitive information. Note that `DB_PORT` is typically `3306` for MySQL.
  *  **dbsql.sql** This file contains the SQL statements to create the necessary tables for the database. It is a dump file of the DB we constructed with the use of MySQLWorkbench.

### 3. Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

## Accessing the API Interface

You can explore and interact with the backend API directly through the SwaggerHub interface:
1. **Explore Endpoints:** Within SwaggerHub, you can browse the available API endpoints, see the request parameters, and test the endpoints by sending requests directly from the interface.
    * **Note:** Make sure that the database is running before you use your interface in order to obtain data.
2. **View API Documentation:**
SwaggerHub provides detailed documentation for each API endpoint, including descriptions of request parameters, expected responses, and error codes. Use this documentation to understand how to properly interact with the API.

    * **GET -->** is used to retrieve data from the server.
    * **PUT -->** is used to update existing data.
    * **DELETE -->** is used to remove data from the database.
    * **POST -->** is used to create elements
3. **Test API Responses:**
Use SwaggerHub’s built-in testing capabilities to validate the responses from each endpoint.

    * **Check for proper status codes**, such as 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, or 500 Internal Server Error.
